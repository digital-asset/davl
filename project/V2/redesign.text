Redesign V2, goals:

- Handle the visibility issue.
- The boss-of relationship is entirely transitory.
- Any worker can be the boss of another at the behest of the company.
- Being a boss-of another simply means being able to approve/deny their vacation requests.
- No constraints on boss-of structure. Allow: self-boss, multi-boss, cyclic-boss, no-boss.

Workflow...

Company:
+ propose worker relationship (allowing company to make any worker a boss of another)
+ allocate N-days holiday to worker
+ allocate a worker as a (no-exclusive) team-member of another worker (boss role)
+ de-allocate a worker to a boss
X see the org chart: worker->[worker] boss-of links

Worker
+ accept worker relationship
+ who are my bosses now?
+ make a vacation request for a list of dates (no holiday allocation needed at this time)
+ cancel a request
+ count unspent holiday allocation
+ count unspent holiday allocation - days for pending request
+ view denials
+ view open(pending) requests
+ view booked vacations of everyone

Worker (in Boss role)
+ who works for me now?
+ see pending vacations requests from my team
+ approve a team member's pending request
+ deny a team member's pending request
X see denials I made

review with Gary
- HR instead of company?
- As* contracts.. Always making choices consuming to force the create/exercise workflow?
- "subordinate" instead of "team" -- or just use "minion"
- How does the frontend discover what `workflow' choices are available?
- should ProposeWorker also have contract key, for discovery by accept choice?
